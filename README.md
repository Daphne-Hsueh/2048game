2. Run `npm start` to start project

### Rules

- **GOAL** : To create tile with the number 2048
- **Movement**: Players can slide the tiles in one of four directions: up , down, left, or right.Each swipe moves all tiles on the board in the chosen direction until they either hit the edge of the grid or another tile.
- **Merging Tiles**: If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into one tile whose value is the total sum of the two original tiles. For example, two tiles with the number 2 will merge into a single tile with the number 4.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the board is filled with tiles and no more moves are possibleâ€”meaning no adjacent tiles can be combined and no empty spaces are available for new tiles to appear.
